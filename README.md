# TTGO_TDisplay-basic_demo
Basic demo of TTGO "T-Display" ESP32 module with 1.14" color screen features.

Demonstrates screen use, WiFi scan, battery level read, button access, nonvolatile memory, and power control.
Recreates the module's "Factory Test" app but prettier, simpler, fully commented and minimum dependencies.
